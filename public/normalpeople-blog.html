                <i>Dear reader,</i>
            </div>
            <p>Recently I've read the book Normal People by Sally Rooney and straight away I fell in love with it. After reading the book
                I decided to watch the series so i could watch the tiktok edits and pinterest pins without having spoilers, and don't regret
                a minute of it! Today I'm going to share some of my thoughts on it.
            </p>

            <p>Normal People portrays the lives of Connel and Marianne from the end of high school to the end of college. 
                The book begins with Comel's mother being a cleaner at Marianne's house, a class struggle (a subject 
                that persists throughout the book) and from there the meetings and disagreements of the two, Marianne's laissez
                faire attitude, Connel's insecurity and shyness, all marked by a gigantic lack of communication, but at the same
                 time <span>I can understand almost everything the two do, even if I don't agree sometimes.</span></p>
            <p>The beginning of the book, where they're applying to universities, was particularly striking and I felt exactly like 
                Connel. This book has some strong scenes, but they make sense for the plot of the book. Another thing, many people 
                are bothered by the author's way of writing without demarcating the lines, but I wasn't bothered, I think it helped 
                the sense of the book since it shows this style of flow of thought that brings us closer to the character's mental 
                state. In addition, among the books I've read, the one that left me thinking the most, maybe a little melancholy, I 
                think this book is necessary for everyone to read, it deals with very important issues. </p>

            <p> About the series, I thought they portraied very well the relationship between the two and their feelings. However, I think
                the experience is better when you read the book before watching the series. That way when you see the characters, you already 
                know what they're going through and thinking, so it's easier to relate to them. I do think they could portray the character's feelings 
                in a better way. I love how they made the series story as close as possible to the book, and even with 12 episodes 
                I still don't think it's enough, I think it felt a bit rushed.</p>
            </p>
            <p>Overall I found the story very endearing and I was rooting for the characters all the time, I was sad along with 
                them (which was +/- the whole book). it's quite a sad and melancholy book, so, but I loved it too much, it's an 
                incredible exploration of the human experience â™¡</p>
