                    <h2>But what is formula 1?</h2>
                    <p>Formula 1 is a car racing sport. But overall, it's about strategy, engineering, sportsmanship and a life style!</p>
                    <p>Every year occurs two championships, the drivers championship(wins the driver with most points accumulated during the season) 
                        and the constructors championship(wins the team with biggest sum of points between their both drivers)</p>
                    <p>In the sport there are multiple teams, each with two drivers, and their goal is to win the most points they can in the season.</p>
                    <p>In a season(a year) there are 24 Gran Prix. The Grand Prixes are the races. They are distributed along the year and always occur on sundays
                        , but the week and weekend before the race are always very eventful. We call them raceweeks and raceweekends.</p>

                                    During these sessions, teams familiarize themselves with the track, test car setups, and

                        <p>Ayrton Senna wasn‚Äôt just a Formula 1 driver ‚Äî he was a force of nature. With unmatched precision, 
                        fearless speed, and deep passion, he became a three-time world champion and one of the greatest 
                        racers the world has ever seen. But beyond the track, Senna was a complex and deeply human figure: 
                        spiritual, fiercely competitive, and devoted to helping others. His mysterious intensity, breathtaking 
                        wet-weather drives, and tragic death at just 34 left the world in awe ‚Äî and in tears. To know Senna is 
                        to witness brilliance, courage, and a legacy that still inspires. Once you start learning about him, you won‚Äôt want to stop.
