                <hr>
                <p>Welcome to my pit stop, here you'll find everything you need for your car.</p>
                <h2>But what is formula 1?</h2>
                <p>Formula 1 is a car racing sport. But overall, it's about strategy, engineering, sportsmanship and a life style!</p>
                <p>Every year occurs two championships, the drivers championship(wins the driver with most points accumulated during the season) 
                    and the constructors championship(wins the team with biggest sum of points between their both drivers)</p>
                <p>In the sport there are multiple teams, each with two drivers, and their goal is to win the most points they can in the season.</p>
                <p>In a season(a year) there are 24 Gran Prix. The Grand Prixes are the races. They are distributed along the year and always occur on sundays
                    , but the week and weekend before the race are always very eventful. We call them raceweeks and raceweekends.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>Each raceweek follows this schedule:</p>

                                During these sessions, teams familiarize themselves with the track, test car setups, and 
                                gather data to optimize performance for qualifying and the race. </span></span></li>
