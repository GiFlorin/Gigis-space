                    <p>Originally released in 1938, Vidas secas portrays the miserable life of a 
                        family of backland retreatants forced to move from time to time to areas 
                        less punished by drought. The father, Fabiano, walks through the arid landscape 
                        of the caatinga in the northeast of Brazil with his wife, Sinha Vitória, and their 
                        two children, who have no names, being called only “older son” and “younger son”. 
                        They are also accompanied by the family dog, Baleia, whose name is ironic because 
                        the lack of food has made her very thin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vidas Secas belongs to the second modernist phase of Brazilian literature, known as 
                        the “regionalist” or “novel of the 1930s”. It strongly denounces the ills of the 
                        Brazilian people, especially the misery of the northeastern hinterland. It is the novel 
                        in which Graciliano achieves the maximum expression that he had been seeking in his prose: 
                        what drives the characters is the drought, harsh and cruel, and paradoxically the telluric, 
                        affective connection that it exposes in those beings in retreat, looking for means of survival 
                        and a future.

                    <p>After breaking up with her boyfriend, Tiffy is looking to move out of her now ex’s 
                        apartment and into a place of her own. As an underpaid assistant editor, however, she 
                        cannot afford much in the London housing market. When she reads an advert for a very affordable 
                        flatshare that involves sharing not only the apartment but also the bed with someone who 
                        works a night shift, she decides to take a chance and go for it. After all, the ad says that 
                        the roommate, Leon, will only be in the apartment from 9am to 6pm Monday through Friday, and 
                        the rest of the time, it will be all hers. Shortly after moving in, Tiffy begins to exchange 
                        notes with Leon, initially about mundane things like putting the toilet seat down, but 
                        their correspondence gradually becomes more personal. In spite of her friends’ warnings 
                        that romance between roommates never ends well, Tiffy finds herself wishing she could meet Leon, 
                        but the flatshare agreement clearly states that they are not supposed to meet...And Leon’s girlfriend 
                        intends to see that that end of the bargain is held up.

                    and a nice one to get out of a reading slump if you like romance. It also has no spicy scenes.

                    <p>First published in 1875, José de Alencar's novel Senhora belongs to the Romantic period. 
                        The book is divided into four parts - the price, discharge, possession and redemption - 
                        and its central theme is marriage for interest.
                    </p>
                    <p>The protagonist Aurélia Camargo is the daughter of a poor seamstress and wants to marry her boyfriend, 
                        Fernando Seixas. The boy, however, swaps Aurélia for Adelaide Amaral, a rich girl who would provide 
                        a more promising future.</p>
                    <p>Time passes and Aurélia becomes an orphan and receives a huge inheritance from her grandfather. 
                        With the fortune she acquires, the girl rises socially and begins to be seen in a different light, 
                        starting to be coveted by interested suitors.</p>
                    <p>When she learned that her old boyfriend was still single and in dire financial straits, Aurélia decided 
                        to take revenge for her abandonment and offered to buy him out. The two finally get married.</p>
                    <p>Fernando puts up with his wife's taunts until he manages to work and earn enough money to cover what she 
                        had spent on the wedding, thus buying his “freedom”. Aurelia notices the change in Fernando's attitude 
                        and the couple make up, finally consummating the marriage.</p>

                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p class="review"> I did not enjoy reading this book because i could not get into it or understand an entire paragraph,
                     it used a very complicated language, which is understandable for an old book, it was just not my style. 
                     Maybe if i read it again with my current mentality and understanding it would have been better.

                    <p>Capitães da Areia, the raw and moving story of poor boys living in an abandoned 
                        wharf in Salvador, is perhaps Jorge Amado's most influential novel. An absolute 
                        classic of books about abandoned childhood, it has haunted and enchanted generations 
                        of readers and remains as relevant today as it was at the time it was written.</p>

                    <p>Since its release in 1937, Capitães da Areia has caused scandal: countless copies of the
                         book were burned in public squares by order of the Estado Novo. Over the course of seven 
                         decades, the narrative hasn't lost any of its luster or topicality: on the contrary, the 
                         urban life of poor boys and offenders has taken on tragic and urgent contours.</p>
                        
                    <p>Several generations of Brazilians have suffered the impact and seduction of these boys who 
                        live in an abandoned wharf on Salvador's docks, living on the fringes of social conventions.</p>
                    <p>A true formative novel, the book makes us intimate with its little creatures, each with their
                          own needs and ambitions: from the leader Pedro Bala to the religious Pirulito, from the resentful 
                          and cruel Sem-Pernas to the pimp's apprentice Gato, from the sensible Professor to the rustic 
                          backwoodsman Volta Seca. With the engaging force of his prose, Jorge Amado brings us closer 
                          to these boys and infects us with their intense desire for freedom.</p>

                    <p>Capitães da Areia, the raw and moving story of poor boys living in an abandoned 
                        wharf in Salvador, is perhaps Jorge Amado's most influential novel. An absolute 
                        classic of books about abandoned childhood, it has haunted and enchanted generations 
                        of readers and remains as relevant today as it was at the time it was written.</p>

                    <p>Since its release in 1937, Capitães da Areia has caused scandal: countless copies of the
                         book were burned in public squares by order of the Estado Novo. Over the course of seven 
                         decades, the narrative hasn't lost any of its luster or topicality: on the contrary, the 
                         urban life of poor boys and offenders has taken on tragic and urgent contours.</p>
                        
                    <p>Several generations of Brazilians have suffered the impact and seduction of these boys who 
                        live in an abandoned wharf on Salvador's docks, living on the fringes of social conventions.</p>
                    <p>A true formative novel, the book makes us intimate with its little creatures, each with their
                          own needs and ambitions: from the leader Pedro Bala to the religious Pirulito, from the resentful 
                          and cruel Sem-Pernas to the pimp's apprentice Gato, from the sensible Professor to the rustic 
                          backwoodsman Volta Seca. With the engaging force of his prose, Jorge Amado brings us closer 
                          to these boys and infects us with their intense desire for freedom.</p>
